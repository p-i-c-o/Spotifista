# Spotifista

Spotifista is a Spotify Download tool.\
It lets you mass download songs from Spotify.

## How it works üîé
Spotifista *technically* doesn't work via Spotify, but works with YouTube. It takes song titles and song artists from a csv file with your Spotify
playlist. It then searches them up on YouTube and downloads them as MP3s!
